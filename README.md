# README

This project was created to demonstrate my coding skills.

Things that still need work:

- No error messages (there is for api, but not for app)
- Flash messages aren't pretty
- No validation for fields (e.g. time(mins) could have any string)
- Manager can't create users (needs full CRUD)
- "Single Page" is only in a sneaky way (server sends html through ajax). Server should send html once, then only api calls after that. The client should generate html from there.
- api is brokenâ€”on its own it's fine, it's broken because I have a non-api controller with the same name.
